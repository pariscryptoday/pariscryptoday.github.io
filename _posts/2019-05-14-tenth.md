### Abstracts

**<a name="WB"></a>On Sigma Protocols with Helper for MQ and PKP, Fishy Signature Schemes and More**<br>
*Ward Beullens (KU Leuven)*

This work presents 2 sigma protocols with helper to prove knowledge of:

* A solution to a system of quadratic polynomials
* A solution to an instance of the Permuted Kernel Problem

We then remove the helper from the protocol with a "cut-and-choose" protocol and we apply the Fiat-Shamir transform to obtain signature schemes with security proof in the QROM. We show that the resulting signature schemes, which we call the "MUltivarite quaDratic FIat-SHamir" scheme (MUDFISH) and the "ShUffled Solution to Homogeneous linear SYstem FIat-SHamir" scheme (SUSHSYFISH), are more efficient than existing signatures based on the MQ problem and the Permuted Kernel Problem. We also leverage the ZK-proof for PKP to improve the efficiency of Stern-like Zero Knowledge proofs for lattice statements.

**<a name="AC"></a>Freedom of Encryption**<br>
*Aisling Connolly (ENS)*

**<a name="RT"></a>Degree 2 is Complete for the Round-Complexity of Malicious MPC**<br>
*Rotem Tsabary (Weizmann)*

We show, via a non-interactive reduction, that the existence of a secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for degree-2 functions implies the existence of a protocol with the same round complexity for general functions. Thus showing that when considering the round complexity of MPC, it is sufficient to consider very simple functions.

Our completeness theorem applies in various settings: information theoretic and computational, fully malicious and malicious with various types of aborts. In fact, we give a master theorem from which all individual settings follow as direct corollaries. Our basic transformation does not require any additional assumptions and incurs communication and computation blow-up which is polynomial in the number of players and in S, 2^D, where S,D are the circuit size and depth of the function to be computed. Using one-way functions as an additional assumption, the exponential dependence on the depth can be removed.

As a consequence, we are able to push the envelope on the state of the art in various settings of MPC, including the following cases.

* 3-round perfectly-secure protocol (with guaranteed output delivery) against an active adversary that corrupts less than a quarter of the parties.
* 2-round statistically-secure protocol that achieves security with ``selective abort'' against an active adversary that corrupts less than half of the parties.
* Assuming one-way functions, 2-round computationally-secure protocol that achieves security with (standard) abort against an active adversary that corrupts less than half of the parties.
	  

**<a name="HW"></a>Encrypted Computation from Lattices**<br>
*Hoeteck Wee (CNRS / ENS / PSL)*

In this talk, we will survey three cryptographic notions of enabling
computation over encrypted data -- attribute-based encryption, fully
homomorphic encryption, and laconic functional evaluation -- as well
as their instantiations from lattices.
