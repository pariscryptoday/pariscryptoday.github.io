### Abstracts

**<a name="DavEva"></a>SECURE MULTI-PARTY COMPUTATION: PROMISES, PROTOCOLS, AND PRACTICALITIES**<br>
*[David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/)* (University of Virginia)

Secure multi-party computation (MPC) provides a way for two (or more) parties to compute a function that depends on inputs from both parties, while keeping their inputs private. A general solution to this problem have been known since Yao's pioneering work on garbled circuits in the 1980s, but only recently has it become conceivable to use this approach in real systems. Over the past decade, the costs of executing MPC protocols have dropped by about 7 orders of magnitude, but real-world deployments remain rare, and mostly unsatisfying. In this talk, I’ll provide a brief introduction to MPC and summarize some of the work our group has done to make secure computation scalable, efficient, and accessible. I’ll describe some attempts to build interesting practical systems with MPC including an ongoing effort to develop a decentralized certificate authority that can produce signed certificates without ever exposing the private signing key. Finally, I’ll discuss the remaining impediments that are holding back MPC from being widely used in practice.

**<a name="IngVer"></a>ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SECURITY FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATIONS**<br>
*[Ingrid Verbauwhede](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~iverbauw/)* (K.U. Leuven)

Energy and power efficiency is an extremely important optimization goal when implementing applications on any digital platform. This is important for light-weight InternetOfThings devices as well as high end servers and cloud computing. The first one requires a long battery life, the second one needs to reduce the cost of cooling (and the electricity bill).

The energy and power optimization also holds for the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Our goal is to build devices that can perform the mathematically demanding cryptographic operations in an efficient way. At the same time, we request that the implementations are also secure against a wide range of physical attacks, including side-channel attacks. Unfortunately countermeasures to side-channel attacks impose an extra cost.

This presentation will focus on the implementation aspects of cryptographic operations and how to balance the computation requirements with the resource constraints. These concepts will be illustrated with the design of several cryptographic co-processors, secret key, public key and new generation of post-quantum secure algorithms.

**<a name="PasPai"></a>WHITEBOX CRYPTOMANIA**<br>
*[Pascal Paillier](https://www.cryptoexperts.com/)* (CryptoExperts)

In the utopic world of whitebox cryptomania, cryptographic programs can be freely executed, copied and shared without endangering their inner secret keys, as breaking them requires intractable computational efforts. Once again, constructive cryptography has prevailed over cryptanalysis thanks to reductionist proofs and tamper-resistant cryptographic software has suddenly become a reality. This talk explores the side effects of this parallel universe on cryptographic constructions - good and bad alike - and what they potentially mean for the security of the Cloud.

**<a name="KenPat"></a>SECURE STORAGE IN THE CLOUD USING PROPERTY PRESERVING ENCRYPTION**<br>
*[Kenneth Paterson](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/)* (Royal Holloway)

In this talk, we'll take a look at how Property Preserving Encryption (PPE) schemes can be used to store data in encrypted form at cloud service providers while still allowing various forms of search queries to be carried out against the data. We'll explain why some of the currently deployed schemes provide insufficient security in practice, and discuss methods by which security can be enhanced whilst preserving search capabilities.

**<a name="RapBos"></a>Σoϕoς - FORWARD SECURE SEARCHABLE ENCRYPTION**<br>
*[Raphael Bost](https://raphael.bost.fyi/)* (Universite Rennes 1)

Searchable Symmetric Encryption aims at making possible searching over an encrypted database stored on an untrusted server while keeping privacy of both the queries and the data, by allowing some small controlled leakage to the server.

Recent work shows that dynamic schemes -- in which the data is efficiently updatable -- leaking some information on updated keywords are subject to devastating adaptative attacks breaking the privacy of the queries. The only way to thwart this attack is to design forward private schemes whose update procedure does not leak if a newly inserted element matches previous search queries.

This work proposes Σoϕoς as a forward private SSE scheme with performance similar to existing less secure schemes, and that is conceptually simpler (and also more efficient) than previous forward private constructions. In particular, it only relies on trapdoor permutations and does not use an ORAM-like construction. We also explain why Σoϕoς is an optimal point of the security/performance tradeoff for SSE.

Finally, an implementation and evaluation results demonstrate its practical efficiency. 

**<a name="SerGor"></a>IRON: FUNCTIONAL ENCRYPTION USING INTEL SGX**<br>
*[Sergey Gorbunov](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~sgorbuno/)* (University of Waterloo)

Functional encryption (FE) is an extremely powerful cryptographic mechanism that lets an authorized entity compute on encrypted data, and learn the results in the clear. However, all current cryptographic instantiations for general FE are too impractical to be implemented. We build Iron, a practical and usable FE system using Intel’s recent Software Guard Extensions (SGX). We show that Iron can be applied to complex functionalities, and even for simple functions, outperforms the best known cryptographic schemes. We argue security by modeling FE in the context of hardware elements, and prove that Iron satisfies the security model.
