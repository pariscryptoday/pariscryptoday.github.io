*[Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/)* (Stanford)

Cryptocurrencies raise many new questions in cryptography, including in the area of digital signatures. In this talk we will describe recent progress on signatures, aggregate signatures, and multi-signatures that is motivated by their use in cryptocurrencies. These new constructions show how modern signatures can significantly shrink the size of the blockchain.

This is joint work with Manu Drijvers and Gregory Neven.
